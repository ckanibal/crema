# Clonk Rage Enhanced Reference Analyzer (CREMA)
A little web-based tool that queries a Clonk Rage masterserver and knocks on all TCP-addresses it finds. This allows for a good estimation whether a given reference can be joined by other players. If your reference is listed with a warning or danger sign, you probably have to add a port-forwarding rule in your router!
